///     this runtime checks;
///   - static fields that are no longer initonly: the game fills DefOf fields by reflection, which this runtime
///     refuses for a readonly field once the type is initialized (it aborts the whole DefOf binding);
///   - calls to Mono's Array.UnsafeLoad<T>/UnsafeStore<T> (Fishery, Adaptive Storage) turned into ldelem/stelem: this
///     runtime's CoreLib has no such methods;
///   - the same for assemblies embedded as resources (a mod that loads its real code from memory never shows it as a file);
///   - attributes whose type does not exist removed (Mono passes over them, this runtime throws from every attribute query);
///   - calls to a method that the game's current version has only with more optional parameters at the end, or with
///     another return type that converts implicitly to the old one, adapted the way a recompilation would;
///   - an override of a game method by its old return type, where the old type converts implicitly to the new one,
///     joined by the override the game does call, which returns the mod's result;

///   - the three things Ludeon's runtime finds for a mod where the stock one does not (its LaxTypeRefResolution,
///     LaxMemberSignatures and LaxPrivateFieldNames): a framework type referenced in an assembly that does not have
///     it (Adaptive Storage's Unsafe "in mscorlib", DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler "in 0Harmony") pointed at the one

	/// runtime finds nothing for it to override and gives it a slot of its own: the game calls its own method and the
	/// mod's never runs (Miho's psycasts could be cast without psyfocus and past the heat limit). Unlike a call, this
	/// would not recompile either; but where the old return type converts implicitly to the new one, what the author
	/// has to write is plain: the override by the new signature, returning what the old one returns. That method is
	/// added: it calls the mod's method (virtually: a class derived from this one overrides the old signature) and
	/// converts the result. The mod's method is marked as what it already is in effect, a new virtual method.
	///
	/// Only for a virtual method of the game's own assembly, taken from the nearest base type that has a virtual method
	/// of that name and those parameters, in a class that is not generic and has no method by the new signature. (Two
	/// methods of one name that differ in the return type only: a lookup by name alone, Type.GetMethod("get_CanCast")
	/// on the mod's class, finds two now. Nothing among the mods here does that.)
