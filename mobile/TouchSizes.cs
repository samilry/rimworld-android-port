	///   thing filters      (storage, bills, outfits...) the lines of the tree are 20 units with 2 between them; here
	///                      10 between them, so that a finger between two checkboxes is nearer to one of them
	///                      (TapAssist then presses that one). The lines themselves are drawn as they were.
	///                      filterRowGap=10 (0 leaves it);
	///   time controls      the pause and speed buttons are 32 x 24 units (3.3 x 2.5 mm) in a row; here 1.4 times that,
	///                      which still fits the column they are in. timeButtons=1.4 (0 or 1 leaves them). Left alone
