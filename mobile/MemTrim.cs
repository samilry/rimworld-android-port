	/// <summary>
	/// After a load (the start, up to the main menu; a saved game or a new one, up to the map) the process holds a lot
	/// that the load needed and the game does not:
	///   - the collector's heap for large objects is mostly holes. Loading allocates large arrays by the hundred (the
	///     parsed XML, decoding buffers, the map's meshes being built); the game's own full collections at the end of
	///     a load free them, but large objects are never moved, so the heap stays as large as it was at its peak
	///     (measured without mods, in a 250 map with 100 colonists: 440 MiB committed for 80 MiB of live arrays).
	///     One collection that moves them gives the holes back.
	///   - every page of the asset packs that was read is still mapped: the engine maps each Assets.zip whole and
	///     reads textures and sounds straight from the mapping (720 MiB for the official content). They are clean
	///     file pages and the kernel may drop them whenever it likes, but as long as they are mapped they count as
	///     this process's memory, for the system's own bookkeeping and for the phone's watchdogs. Letting go of them
	///     costs a page fault for what is read again (the page cache usually still has it).
	///   - the allocator keeps freed pages for a while; it is asked to give them back now.
	///   - textures that were loaded and never drawn are let go (ColdTextures).
	///   - the XML of every def is still there. While the defs are parsed the game notes XML nodes in two lists of its
	///     translation key system (TKeySystem.keys and treatAsList), for working out a table that this version of the game
	///     no longer works out (it brings the table ready-made). Nothing reads the lists after that, but through them
	///     the whole document stays alive: with 106 mods 2.6 million XML objects, well over 100 MiB.
	/// mobile.txt: trimAfterLoad=0 switches all of it off.
