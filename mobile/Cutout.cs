	/// The camera's hole (the display cutout) covers no part of the interface; the picture still fills the screen.
	///
	/// The window is laid out over the hole (MainActivity: the map is drawn under it). Where the hole is, the activity
	/// reads from the system's insets for the screen's present turn (any phone: a hole in the middle of a side, in a
	/// corner, a notch, two holes; none on a phone with the camera under the screen) and the GLFW shim hands it over
	/// (glfwAndroidCutout, asked once a second). Only what would lie over the hole is moved, away from the edge the hole
	/// is at:
	///   - windows (the architect's menu, the main tabs, the inspect pane, float menus, dialogs), before the window stack
	///     draws them: moved aside, made narrower where there is no room;
	///   - the resource readout at the top left, and the column at the bottom right (time controls, date and weather,
	///     letters, alerts), as a whole, when they reach the hole;
	///   - what the architect's menu and the inspect pane draw outside their windows (their ExtraOnGUI), with them, when
	///     they were moved off a hole at the left: the grid of commands (it begins at a fixed x, 210 for the architect,
	///     the pane's width for a selection), the architect's info box above the menu, a tool's controls, the inspect
	///     pane's tabs (immediate windows at x 0). The user, 2026-10-23: the menu moved, the first commands were under
	///     it, and the info box stayed at the edge. The resource readout goes behind the moved info box with them;
	///   - an immediate window asked for while the windows are drawn (the inspect pane's tab), which the move of the
	///     windows comes too early for: when it is asked for;
	///   - the inspect pane's row of tabs, with the pane; and the fill the game draws in that row from the screen's edge
	///     to the first tab while a tab is open (it joins the tab's window to the row) begins where that window is. The
	///     user, 2026-10-24: with the tab moved off a hole at the left, the fill stayed at the edge as a black bar. Where
	///     that window is drawn counts: RimHUD's taller tab window, above the screen's top, is drawn smaller and centred
	///     on itself (WindowFit). RimHUD draws the row itself, in a prefix of DoTabs that skips the game's: its method is
	///     rewritten the same way when it is there.
	/// Nothing on the map moves: the game and the mods place labels there by the camera's screen position.
	/// A black band beside the hole (the window kept clear of it, LAYOUT_IN_DISPLAY_CUTOUT_MODE_NEVER) was tried first and
	/// turned down by the user ("太难看了").
	/// Options, interface page: "避开摄像头挖孔", on by default, at once (mobile.txt avoidCutout=0 switches it off;
	/// cutoutMirror=1 puts the hole on the other side, for trying the right column without turning the phone over).
