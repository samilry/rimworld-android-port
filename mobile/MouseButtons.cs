	/// The left and the right mouse button for a finger: two round buttons of their own, "左键" and "右键", shown while a
	/// game is played with fingers (the user, 2026-10-30: "将左右键从按键盘分离出来，把两个按键做成单独存在，可自由移动").
	/// Until then they were switches of the key wheel, and with the right one on every touch was a right click until the
	/// player switched back: three to five taps for one right click. Now a right click costs one tap more than a left one:
	///   a tap on 右键    the next touch is a right click, pressed from its landing to its lifting; touches are left
	///                    clicks again once that finger lifts. It shows yellow, "一次"; tapped again, it is taken back.
	///   a hold on 右键   every touch is a right click until 左键 or 右键 is tapped. It shows red, "锁定", as soon as
	///                    the finger has rested long enough (with the sound of a switch, as the finger covers it), and
	///                    holds once the finger lifts; a finger that drags the button instead locks nothing.
	///   a tap on 左键    left clicks again, whatever was on: the right button, or the wheel's middle one.
	/// The middle button stays a switch on the key wheel (KeyWheel); it is held here with the right one, one of the three
	/// at a time as before, and the wheel's closed button still says when the right or the middle one is on. Everything
	/// else about right clicks is Touch's as before (a hold on the map with a colonist selected, a hold on a letter, the
	/// Shift and Ctrl that the wheel holds down come with a right click too). A touch on these buttons or on the wheel is
	/// always the left button, taken by the button's own window: it never reaches the game, and it does not spend a right
	/// click waiting for the next touch.
	/// They are first put at the right of the screen (DefaultCenter). Each button is moved by dragging it, as the wheel's
	/// button is (mobile.txt mouseLeftAt=X,Y and mouseRightAt=X,Y, the centre in interface units), kept on the screen and
	/// off the camera's hole (Cutout); the wheel's keys go round them.
	/// They look like the wheel's button and have its size. Left out while the game's own mouse handling is on
	/// (InputMode: the mouse has buttons of its own; they come back once a finger touches the screen after the mouse has
	/// gone), and outside a game (the user, of the menus: "使用触控可以完美控制"). Options → Interface "显示鼠标左右键"
	/// (mobile.txt mouseButtons=0 leaves them out).
