	/// The interface under a finger:
	///   lists scroll under a dragging finger, with the game's own Steam Deck code (which it only runs on a Deck),
	///   and such a drag does not drag the window along;
	///   a hold shows the tooltips of what is under the finger at once, keeps them after the finger lifts until
	///   the next touch, and clicks nothing;
	///   the tooltips of a tap do not linger (the engine's mouse stays where the last finger was);
	///   the soft keyboard comes up while a text field has the focus;
	///   a search box (the game's QuickSearchWidget: the info card's, the load dialog's; a mod's, by "search" in its name),
	///   and the name field of a save dialog (the game's, a scenario's, an ideoligion's, a mod list's: Dialog_FileList;
	///   those of mods made like it: NameFields), take the focus only from a finger on them: given the focus by code (as
	///   when their window opens), it is let go at once, so that the keyboard does not come up by itself (testers,
	///   2026-10-22: saving by hand brought it up over the save dialog; the name is typed only to change it). Other text
	///   fields (a name to type in a rename window) keep such a focus until the player has put them away (Done, a finger
	///   elsewhere): from then on they too take it back only from a finger (RimTalk's talk window gives its field the
	///   focus whenever nothing has it, and the keyboard came straight back up). mobile.txt: searchFocusOnTap=0 lets them
	///   all keep it;
	///   a finger that lands anywhere but on a text field, the typing bar or the key wheel takes the focus from the field
	///   that has it once the touch is over, and the keyboard goes down (the game means to do that for its search boxes,
	///   but under this engine the press has already been used by the window when the search box looks at it). Until
	///   then the field keeps it, as under a mouse on the PC: a button that reads it when it is clicked finds it, and the
	///   key wheel's keys go to the field;
	///   the soft keyboard's Done (or Enter) finishes the typing: the field lets go of the focus and the keyboard goes
	///   down. It is not the game's Enter, which accepts or closes the window the field is in (testers, 2026-10-22: a
	///   number typed in the caravan's window cancelled it, a search box kept the keyboard, the debug actions' search ran
	///   the first action). Only a chat's field gets the Enter, which sends (EnterFields).
	/// With a mouse or a keyboard connected the tooltips, the search boxes' focus and the soft keyboard are the game's
	/// again (InputMode).
