	/// <summary>
	/// Ludeon's runtime never copies a method of the game into the code Harmony makes for a patched method
	/// (WaylithClr.JitNoInlinePatchableIntoDynamicMethods, for Assembly-CSharp); the stock runtime does (inlining), and a
	/// patch put on that small method later is then skipped whenever the patched method runs. Two cases met:
	///   - the port's own patches go in at the main menu, after the mods' (Universal Turret Tweaker's patch of
	///     MapInterface.MapInterfaceUpdate held its own copy of DesignatorManager.DesignatorManagerUpdate: the cells a
	///     drag marked for the confirm button were not drawn);
	///   - a mod that patches only when it needs to (Map Preview patches Verse.Rand for its preview thread when a
	///     preview is made; Geological Landforms' patch of MapGenerator.GenerateContentsIntoMap, made at startup, had
	///     Rand.PopState in it: "Stack empty", no preview).
	/// So: every method the first time it is patched (Harmony's PatchFunctions.UpdateWrapper, which every patch goes
	/// through) is looked up among the methods patched before it. Those whose replacement may hold a copy of it get their
	/// replacement made again (by Harmony itself, with their patches as they are): a patched method is not copied into
	/// code compiled after it was patched. While the port puts its own patches in, this waits and is done once for all of
	/// them at the end. For such a batch, and for the mods' patches made before the port, a replacement is made again
	/// only where PortHooks tells that it was made before the first patch of the method it may hold, or cannot tell
	/// (ReplacementCalls.MadeBefore): one made after it cannot hold a copy.
	///
	/// What a replacement may hold is what the stock JIT (.NET 10.0.12) copies into one, measured 2026-10-30 with its
	/// inlining events: what the replacement's code calls (Harmony's final instruction list, kept by PortHooks: the
	/// original as transpiled, and the prefixes, postfixes and finalizers, which are copied in too), what those call, and
	/// so on, 20 levels deep (DEFAULT_MAX_INLINE_DEPTH; ten were measured); a method of up to 128 IL bytes
	/// (JitExtDefaultPolicyMaxIL), of up to 1024 (JitExtDefaultPolicyMaxILProf) where the replacement is one straight run
	/// of code with few calls (a postfix on a getter), of any size where it asks for it (AggressiveInlining); never one
	/// with a catch, a NoInlining or synchronized one, nor one called virtually that the JIT cannot resolve from the code
	/// alone (where it knows the object's exact type it can; none such was found). A try/finally is copied in (a lock, a
	/// using, a foreach; GUI.ProcessPendingWindows into ImguiDispatch.Dispatch, below), and so are fault and filter
	/// blocks; a catch is not, even where the method asks for it ("has exception handling"). Until 2026-10-30 only the
	/// original's own code was looked at, two levels and 100 bytes deep: a postfix's call of Rand.Value (Vanilla
	/// Expanded), a transpiler's call, or Bombardment.TryDoExplosion -> FloatRange.RandomInRange -> Rand.Range ->
	/// Rand.Value were missed. The framework's code is not followed (it does not call the game), and on the PC its
	/// methods are copied into replacements as here. Measured on the PC's stock .NET 10.0.12 with the game, the 1049
	/// methods the owner's 130 mods patch (each given an empty postfix, in their order) and then the port's own targets:
	/// the old way left 22 copies of patched methods in 22 replacements, this one none (PortHooks' InlineWatch, overload
	/// by overload), reading the code in 250-290 ms instead of 100. Started as on the phone (PortHooks' patch of
	/// Log.Warning first), it made 835 replacements again, where the old way made 464, in 2.7-2.9 s; going by the order
	/// of the replacements it makes 381 in 1.3-1.4 s (256 of 467 for the mods' patches before the port, 125 of 368 for
	/// the port's own), still leaving none. Of the 368, about 200 were for the Recorder's count of Log.Warning, which
	/// takes a lock and so may be in 271 replacements, all of them made after PortHooks' patch of it; the Recorder now
	/// counts through that patch and puts none of its own on Log.Warning.
	///
	/// The engine's own code is the other half. Its per-frame methods are compiled at full optimisation during the
	/// loading screens, before the port is there, and they may hold a copy of a small engine method the port patches
	/// (1.7.4979 made GUI.ProcessPendingWindows two calls in a try/finally, and ImguiDispatch.Dispatch took it in: the
	/// tap assist and the agent no longer saw the end of a frame). So, once, after the port's patches: every method of
	/// the engine's assemblies whose code calls one of the small engine methods the port patched is made again too
	/// (Harmony, with an empty postfix).
