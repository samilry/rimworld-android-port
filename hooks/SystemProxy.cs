	/// The phone's HTTP proxy for HttpClient and what is built on it (WebClient, ClientWebSocket, the engine's
	/// UnityWebRequest), as the PC's runtime follows Windows' proxy settings (HttpWindowsProxy: the manual proxy or a PAC
	/// script, read again whenever they change). The runtime for Android reads only http_proxy, https_proxy and all_proxy,
	/// so a proxy set for the Wi-Fi network, a global one or a VPN app's was never used: mods' requests (RimTalk's model
	/// servers, HugsLib's log upload) went straight out where on the PC they go through Clash or v2rayN in "system proxy"
	/// mode. Each request now asks Android which proxy it gives that address (MainActivity.proxyForUtf8: Java's
	/// ProxySelector, which the system sets up for the app and again on every change, a PAC script included). As on the
	/// PC, http_proxy, https_proxy or all_proxy in runtime.env come first: the runtime's own handling of them stays.
