	/// <summary>
	/// Makes the code of a patched method acceptable to this runtime where a transpiler written for Mono left it
	/// unbalanced: values still on the evaluation stack at a jump whose target expects fewer.
	///
	/// Two of the owner's mods do this. MinifyEverything turns "ldfld category; ldc.i4.3; bne.un L" into
	/// "ldfld category; ldc.i4.3; br L" (two values left); Humanoid Alien Races wraps ApplyBirthOutcome in a loop,
	/// "call ApplyBirthOutcome; br Loop" (the returned Thing left). Mono's JIT does not compare stack depths where
	/// control flow joins, so there the extra values are simply lost and the patches have worked for years; this
	/// runtime's JIT refuses the whole method ("Common Language Runtime detected an invalid program"), which takes the
	/// patch, or the mod that applies it in its constructor, down.
	///
	/// Harmony's instruction list for the replacement method passes through here just before it is emitted
	/// (patch/Patch.cs adds the call at the start of HarmonyLib.MethodCreatorTools.EmitCodes). The stack depth is
	/// followed along every path; where an unconditional jump or the fall into a jump target arrives with more values
	/// than the least any path brings there, "pop" instructions are put in front. A list that is balanced, which is
	/// nearly all of them, is left exactly as it is; so is one that cannot be followed with certainty (calli, a method
	/// with a variable argument list, a path that would take more than the stack holds) or cannot be repaired this way
	/// (a conditional jump with extra values).
	///
	/// Two more places where the runtime wants the stack empty and the PC's runtime does not insist (its JIT has the
	/// switches LaxILStack and LaxRetInTry): the start of a try block, and the return of a method that returns nothing.
	/// Vanilla Gravship Expanded (2026-10-21) turns the call "DrawFieldEdges(cells, 2900)" in
	/// GravshipLandingMarker.DrawAt into a single "pop", so the cells stay on the stack into the try block of the
	/// foreach that follows; here the whole mod failed in its constructor ("invalid program"). The values are popped
	/// in front of the try block (outside it) or of the return.
	///
	/// Harmony 3 follows the stack itself before the JIT sees the method (DynamicMethodBodyWriter.MaximumStack throws
	/// "Inconsistent stack depth" where two paths bring different depths), on the PC as here. Two more shapes get past
	/// it that the PC's JIT runs and this one refuses (measured 2026-10-30 with the same Harmony on both runtimes, the
	/// PC's own runtime files, and transpilers that leave each shape); here they run as they do there:
	///   - values under the return value of a method that returns something, as many on every path: the PC returns the
	///     top one. Here it is put aside in a local while the others are popped. Not where the return comes right after
	///     a call: the JIT takes "call; ret" for a tail call and wants nothing else on the stack, and the PC refuses the
	///     method then too ("Stack should be empty after tailcall").
	///   - a jump out of a try block or a catch handler: Harmony turns a transpiler's "ret" there into a "br" to the end
	///     of the original, and the PC's JIT runs such a jump as a leave (WaylithClr's JitLaxRetInTry; finally blocks
	///     run). With nothing on the stack it becomes a leave here, and so does one in code no path reaches (the JIT
	///     checks every jump, reached or not). A jump that carries a value out (the return value of a "ret" in a try) is
	///     left as it is: the PC runs some such methods, the value lost on that path (the type's default comes back), and
	///     refuses others ("stack underflow"), with or without a finally, by how the code around the jump is laid out (21
	///     shapes measured: 11 run, 10 refused), not by a rule that could be followed here.
	/// Where the original's returns meet, a method that returns something keeps the return value on top and what a
	/// transpiler left over under it, so paths that arrive there with different depths get no pops: the PC's Harmony
	/// refuses that method, and here Harmony is left to refuse it too. Until 2026-10-30 the pops took the return value
	/// itself, and the patched method returned whatever had been under it.
